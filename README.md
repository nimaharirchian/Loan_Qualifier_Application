# *Loan Qualifier Application*
---

##### The purpose of this project was to add new changes to a loan qualifier application by adding a save_csv function so that the user can save the qualifying data as a file using the CSV library.
---

## *Technologies*
##### The technologies required for the loan qualifier application would be Python, Pandas, fire, and questionary. We used a daily_rate_sheet CSV file for the list of banks. Fire allows the user to convert python code into command-line-interface by calling it. Questionary allows you to communicate with the CLI. Pandas is able to store and analyze the data from our CSV file.
---
## *Installation Guide*
##### You need to install Fire and questionary in your terminal.
